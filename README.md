# **Hospital-Management-System**
This project is a comprehensive Hospital Management System (HMS) that streamlines hospital operations by integrating patient registration, doctor management, appointment scheduling, emergency triage, billing, and AI-assisted diagnosis.

The system uses C++ for backend processing with efficient data structures (queues, priority queues, maps) to manage patients and appointments, while PyQt5 provides a modern, user-friendly GUI. AI recommendations based on patient symptoms help doctors make faster and more accurate decisions.

## Key Features:
OPD and emergency patient handling with FIFO and priority queues
Doctor availability tracking and appointment scheduling
Automated billing with status tracking
AI-based disease prediction and treatment suggestions
Persistent storage using CSV files for records
Modular design for easy maintenance and extension

## Achievements:
Fast response time (<100ms)
Accurate patient record management
Seamless C++ and Python integration via pybind11
Easy-to-use, interactive GUI for hospital staff

## Note :
2 Zip files are attached anyone can be used
